# Scanner version audit — 30 October 2026

Latest stable upstream releases were checked against GitHub Releases and npm registry metadata. Pins remain reproducible; no rolling latest tags or paid upgrades are introduced.

| Component | Configured version | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Trivy CLI | 0.76.1 | Latest stable |
| Trivy Action | 0.36.0, commit ed142fd0673e97e23eac54620cfb913e5ce36c25 | Updated from 0.35.0 |
| Semgrep CE | 1.183.0 | Updated from 1.159.0; tools/security/requirements.txt is monitored by Dependabot |
| CodeQL Action | 4.39.1, commit 9b3254085494b55a0f7c4c2b3d2d52cc712ce370 | Already current; do not confuse action releases with codeql-bundle releases |
| Sonar scan action | 8.4.0 | Already current |
| SonarScanner CLI | 8.3.0.16463 (bundled by action) | Latest stable checked |
| SpotBugs Maven template | 4.10.5.0 (engine 4.10.5) | Already current; pending actual backend adoption |
| Find Security Bugs template | 1.14.0 | Already current; pending actual backend adoption |
| React Hooks ESLint plugin | 7.1.1 | Latest npm stable |
| JSX accessibility plugin | 6.10.2 | Latest npm stable; excludes ESLint 10 from its peer range |
| typescript-eslint | 8.72.1 | Latest npm stable; supports TypeScript >=4.8.4 <6.1.0 |
| ESLint / @eslint/js | 9.39.5 | Compatibility exception: latest ESLint is 10.14.0 and @eslint/js is 10.0.1, but jsx-a11y does not declare ESLint 10 support |
| TypeScript | 6.0.3 | Updated from 5.9.3; latest npm stable 7.0.2 is outside typescript-eslint's supported range |
| globals | 17.13.0 | Updated from 16.5.0 |

ESLint 9 is EOL upstream. This is an explicit temporary compatibility exception, not a claim that all tools are at the latest major. Upgrade to ESLint 10 once jsx-a11y declares support, or separately review/test a maintained accessibility alternative. Do not install paid extended support, force peer dependency resolution or disable accessibility checks without review.

React migration dependencies rechecked directly against npm stable metadata on 30 October 2026: React/react-dom 19.3.1, Vite 8.3.5, plugin-react 6.1.2, Vitest/coverage-v8 5.0.5, Testing Library React 16.3.3 / DOM 10.4.2 / jest-dom 7.0.1, jsdom 30.1.3 and tsx 4.23.15. React types are 19.3.0. Node types 24.19.2 match the supported Node 24 LTS build/runtime tools; the latest Node 26 types are intentionally not used to expose APIs unavailable in Node 24. TypeScript 7.0.2 remains outside typescript-eslint 8.72.1's explicit >=4.8.4 <6.1.0 range, so retain 6.0.3. Existing Hooks/accessibility/typed rules remain active against real TSX. All app/test dependencies are pinned with a reproducible lockfile; no force/legacy-peer-deps install is used.

ESLint locally passed with the updated lockfile; a temporary unhandled-Promise probe confirmed type-aware scanning with TypeScript 6.0.3. GitHub PR runs validate the updated scanner action and Semgrep. See the PR checks for final results; existing Sonar quality-gate findings are separate from tool-version compatibility.

## Dependency consolidation — RSDSINFRA-27

Combined Dependabot PRs #10 (setup-python 7.1.0), #11 (build-push-action 7.4.0), #12 (setup-node 7.1.0) and #14 (login-action 4.7.0). PRs #13 (ESLint 10.13.0) and #15 (@eslint/js 10.0.1) are deferred: npm metadata rechecked on 30 October 2026 still gives eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y 6.10.2 an ESLint peer range ending at 9. Retain the existing explicit compatibility exception; no forced peer resolution, accessibility-rule removal or paid support. Revisit both upgrades together when supported.

Tracking: https://rsdsoftware.atlassian.net/browse/RSDSINFRA-27. Validate both consolidated PR heads with the local runner and explicit --e2e; browser tests stay disabled by default. PR workflows remain non-deploying.
